I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, and a  
BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like (some) superheroes and puzzles. I solve my Wordle at 12:01 am every day.
Just like most basic people, I like hiking. I also like history tidbits so I listen to 
Behind The Bastards, The Dollop, Well There's Your Problem, Ridiculous History and the like. I'm 
currently reading "Rogues: True Stories of Grifters, Killers, Rebels, and Crooks".
This is the way.

I am a Computer Science undergrad here at UNCG. In my free time I enjoy playing
video games, collecting music, and working out. I am currently preparing for
an IT internship this summer and I am working on learning game development in my
free time.

I just turned 28 this April and will be a senior at UNCG this fall. I work as a part-time 
developer at Fastenal mostly making mobile applications. I have nearly 10 years of experience 
working in factories and manufacturing plants. In my spare time I like to play video games with 
my friends or read fantasy novels. I am currently reading Homeland by R.A. Salvatore as well 
as the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams.
