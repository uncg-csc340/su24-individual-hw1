I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, and a  
BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like (some) superheroes and puzzles. I solve my Wordle at 12:01 am every day.
Just like most basic people, I like hiking. I also like history tidbits so I listen to 
Behind The Bastards, The Dollop, Well There's Your Problem, Ridiculous History and the like. I'm 
currently reading "Rogues: True Stories of Grifters, Killers, Rebels, and Crooks".
This is the way.

Yinong Sheng
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am currently a CS major student coming up to senior class. Originally I wanted to 
pursue an Electrical Engineering degree but I made a slight change of plan after the 
whole AI frenzy took off, shifting my focus towards data analysis and AI related 
areas. I am contributing to the development of an open source creative canvas software 
for stable diffusion, InvokeAI. Additionally, I provide alpha/beta testing for closed 
source mobile camera apps, Moment on iOS and MotionCam on Android. In my free time  
besides gaming, I enjoy photography and listening to music.

I am a Computer Science major here at UNCG. I Currently am a senior and am on my last year,
planning the graduate during the fall semester. I have experience programming in Java, Python,
C++, and C#. Usually with my spare time I like to practice art, reading, going for jogs, and finding
new cafes to go to. I love movies, especially really bad movies cause I think they are the most
fun to watch, especially with friends. 

Trevor Bazen
----------------------------u-------------------------------------------
I am a CS major at UNCG and an upcoming senior, I started as a nursing  
major at UNCW and quickly realized it was not what I wanted to spend the  
rest of my life doing. I transferred to UNCG and switched my major to CS and  
I love it. I like to go to the gym and play golf, I have an 80 pound  
Labradoodle and he has made me completely rethink the idea of having kids.
I plan to move back to the beach with my gf after graduation, and either work  
for a local company or work remotely for others. Thanks!
